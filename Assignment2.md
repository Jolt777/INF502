## Part 1: Dealing with git

1. Describe what is the output of the following commands
    - `git branch`
    - `git checkout BRANCH_NAME (USE THE NAME OF AN EXISTING BRANCH)`
    - `git log --decorate`

```

```

2. Try `git log --graph --all`. What do you see?

```

```

3. Use `git diff BRANCH_Name` to view the differences from a branch and the current branch. 
Summarize the difference from master to the other branch.

```

```

4. Write a command sequence to merge the non-master branch into `master`

```

```

5. Write a command (or sequence) to (i) create a new branch called `math` (from the `master`) and
(ii) change to this branch

```

```

6. Edit B.py adding the following source code below the content you have there

```
print 'I know math, look:'
print 2+2
```

Status: 

7. Write a command (or sequence) to commit your changes

```

```

8. Change back to the `master` branch and change B.py adding the following source code
(commit your change to `master`):

```

```

9. Write a command sequence to merge the `math` branch into `master` and describe what
happened

```

```

10. Write a set of commands to abort the merge

```

```

11. Now repeat item 9, but proceed with the manual merge (Editing B.py). All implemented
functions are needed. Explain your procedure

```

```

12. Write a command (or set of commands) to proceed with the merge and make `master` branch
up-to-date

```

```

## Part 2: Using GitHub

1. Into the students folder, create a file called LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME.md (please change
LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME for your actual last and first names).
2. Use Markdown to structure the following information about the last paper you've read (you can
structure your markdown the way you want):
- Title
- Venue (journal name/conference)
- Number of pages
- 3 outcomes of the paper
- link to the paper online
3. Send your file back to this repository until creating a pull request.
4. Report your experience of making this submission, including the steps followed, commands
used, and hurdles faced (within the file you create for **part 1**)

```
